# kompound

This repo serves as a general collection of useful libraries and one off components I made.
For now this is only odin, but it will eventually probably contain all languages I use that don't have package mangers.

## how to use this ?

If you want to use any of this code in your projects, the esiest way is to just copy and paste the file with it. 
If you need more than 1 or 2 files, or want an even simpler solution, just add this repo as a git submodule to yours. 

## any docs ?

Yes, if I write code in "library mode" i typically leave some mildly informative code comments around, and each directory in this repo
will have a `README` inside explaining what it contains.
